A Journey from 5th Grade

This website is a throwback to my early days as a web developer. It's a fun little game website, that believe it or not, gained quite a following. To keep the project under the radar, it's cleverly tucked away behind another early website I designed just before the game website's release. The main reason for this hidden approach was to make sure the school wouldn't take it down, as this was my first project that had real-world utility.

Please Note
The code behind this project is a bit messy, and I wouldn't recommend using it as a reference for modern web development. It's a charming relic from the past, showcasing my early exploration of the web development world. Feel free to browse around, reminisce, and if you're feeling particularly brave, take a peek at the code (just don't judge too harshly!).
