# GameWebsite
URL: https://stevejobsinfo2.com/

This was a fun little game website I made in 5th grade. It gained a lot of traction and somehow thousands of users. This was my first project that people could utilize in their day-to-day life. It is hidden behind another early website I made right before the game website. This is so the school wouldn't take the website down. I made the website masking the game one and is just an informational site about steve jobs.
